    After learning .css, I've added a stylesheet 
    to the website. I learned how to create a link
    that has the appearance of an image. The
    Peruvian Flag to be more exact. This involved 
    learning to put elements into a container and 
    created a style that would center the image
    both vertically and horizontally.
