    This is an Odin Project about recipes.
    A website that will consist of a main index page.
    Links to a few recipes.

    Practicing: 
    - HTML links, images, and formatting.

    After learning .css, I've added a stylesheet 
    to the website. I learned how to create a link
    that has the appearance of an image. The
    Peruvian Flag to be more exact. This involved 
    learning to put elements into a container and 
    created a style that would center the image
    both vertically and horizontally.

    Attempted to add some .js to website by 
    implementing the current date beneath
    the header on the index.html. This caused 
    a bug where the "Odin" header disappeared and
    formatting on the date is no appearing. 
    Tried putting script into a div and creating a
    class. No luck tonight.
